# About
This is the story of Lonesome Steve and his journey to deep space.

 Jokes aside:
## Main Menu
 The main menu provides the basic functionality such as loading existing saves and options.

## Navigation
Once a game is started, you will have the task of navigating the ship trough a selection of 4 randomly generated planets.
In the navigation you are presented with a selection of 4 randomly generated planets.

To proceed you have to select one of these to approach and scan it for it's resources.
From there, you have the option to either fly to the scanned planet or to approach (and scan) another.
Approaching the selected planet removes another, not scanned, planet from the list of available targets.
Each action consumes resources.
When selecting a scanned planet, you will land on it.

## Gathering resource
Once landed on a planet, you are able to gather any of the available resources.
Be mindful though, as gathering resources is not free.

After stocking up, you have to fly off again, venturing deeper into the Unknown.

## Winning Condition
Landing on the 21 planet.
If any of the resources reaches 0, you lose.
